Go to 192.168.52.128:8080->Manage Jenkins->Configure System->Keep # of executors(It is a part of master) as 3 and Labels as Mas and Usage:Choose Only build jobs..->Save&Apply

Configure->Build Environment->Abort the build if it's stuck ,No Activity  and sec 30  and Timeout-actions :Fail the build and sleep 25->Build Now

Job1->Configure->Discard old builds->Strategy:LogRotation->Days:2 and max # builds:3->Build Now
